## MongoDB Transaction with Session Handling

This document outlines using MongoDB transactions with session handling in an Express application. Transactions allow multiple operations to be executed together as a single atomic operation, ensuring data consistency.

## Overview

In applications where data consistency is crucial (such as financial transactions), MongoDB transactions with session handling help ensure that changes are applied atomically across multiple documents.

#### Example Workflow

This example shows a money transfer between two user accounts using MongoDB transactions.

#### Steps:

1. **Input Validation**
	Validate transaction details, such as sender, receiver, account details, and amount.
	
	Ensure that all necessary fields are present and formatted correctly before initiating the transaction.

2. **Session Initialization and Transaction Start**
	Initialize a MongoDB session and start a transaction at the beginning of the process.
	
	Sessions allow multi-document transactions, ensuring atomicity and isolation across the transaction’s operations.

3. **Transaction Logic**
	Verify the sender’s account balance and ensure it has sufficient funds for the transfer.
	
	Retrieve the receiver's account details to confirm validity.
	
	Deduct the transfer amount from the sender’s balance and add it to the receiver’s balance within the session to ensure consistency.

4. **Commit or Abort Transaction**
	If all operations are successful, commit the transaction to make changes permanent.
	
	If any issues arise (such as insufficient balance or invalid account), abort the transaction to prevent partial changes.
